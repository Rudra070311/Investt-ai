# Contributing to Investt 

First of all — thank you for even thinking about contributing.  
That already puts you ahead of most people.

## Ground Rules

Before contributing, please understand:

- Investt is **education-first**
- We do **not** give investment advice
- Safety (especially for minors) is non-negotiable
- Simplicity > overengineering

If a contribution violates these, it won’t be merged — no hard feelings.

## What You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions in:

- AI moderation improvements
- Better test coverage
- Performance optimizations
- Cleaner abstractions
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes (especially edge cases)

Small PRs are totally fine.

## Code Standards

Please ensure:

- TypeScript strict mode passes
- Tests pass (`npm test`)
- No `any` unless absolutely justified
- Shared logic goes in `/src/shared`
- AI logic stays inside `/src/ai`

If you’re unsure — ask in the PR.

You may:
- Use AI tools to assist you
- Use ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.

But:
- **You must understand the code**
