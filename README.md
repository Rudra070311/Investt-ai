# Open Source at Investt

Investt is built with a simple belief:

> Financial literacy should be accessible, safe, and transparent — especially for teens.

That’s why the **core AI logic of Investt is open-source**.

## Why Open Source?

We chose to open-source parts of Investt because:

- Transparency builds trust
- Young builders learn faster from real systems
- AI systems should be inspectable, not black boxes
- Community feedback makes products safer and better

This repository includes:
- AI moderation logic
- AI chatbot logic
- Feed intelligence foundations
- Shared safety utilities
- Tests (because yes, tests matter)

---

## What’s NOT Here

To be clear, this repo does **not** include:
- Production secrets
- User data
- Private infrastructure keys
- Business-sensitive configs

Safety > hype.

## Who Is This For?

- Student developers
- AI learners
- Open-source contributors
- Anyone curious about building **responsible AI systems**

You are welcome here.
